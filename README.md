## Description 
    This application is called Book Finder & Reviews. It is a webpage that allows users to find a book based on title, author or genre through the OpenLibrary API. The user is also presented with the current New York Times Best Sellers list which presents the user with the Book Title, Author and Genre. 
    
    The main page will hold two buttons that will each house their own form, one that allows the user to search for the book or books of their choosing and another that allows the user to leave a review. The review form will ask the user to make a username, enter the book title, genre, author and a summary of the book. The review will then be presented to the user on a different webpage that will display their review as well as others in the middle section of the screen.
